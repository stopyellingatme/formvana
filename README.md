# Formvana

Out here searching for form nirvana with the help of Typescript and (currently) Svelte.

## VERY EARLY PRE-ALPHA LIBRARY

```commands go here
```

** Main things left to tackle:
 *  - !Field groups and Field ordering (group styling)
 *  - Remove Tailwind dependencies
 *  - Remove Svelte dependency? - Maybe fork it?
 *  - Add more form elements for testing with svelte
 *  - Do some documentation on this mfer
 * 
 *  - Clean up functions and code wherever possible :) 

<!-- *Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 15.7.0 installed, for now.* -->


## So, for now, you can run it like an app

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd formvana
npm i
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running.
