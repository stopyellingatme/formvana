/**
 * Formvana - Form Class
 * Form is NOT valid, initially.
 * If you want to make it valid, this.valid.set(true).
 *
 * The main thing to understand here is that the fields and the model are separate.
 * Fields are built using the model, via the @field() & @editable() decorators.
 * We keep the fields and the model in sync based on the provided form config,
 * but we do our best to initialize it with good, sane defaults.
 *
 *
 * Recommended Use:
 *  - Initialize let form = new Form(model, {refs: REFS, template: TEMPLATE, etc.})
 *  - Set the model (if you didn't in the first step)
 *  - Attach reference data (if you didn't in the first step)
 *  - Storify the form - check example.form.ts for an example
 *  - Now you're ready to use the form!
 *  - Pass it into the DynamicForm component and let the form generate itself!
 *
 * Note: You will probably have to use form and field templates as this lib only comes
 * with default html form layout & fields.
 *
 * Performance is blazing with < 500 fields.
 * Can render up to 2000 inputs in one class, but don't do that.
 * Just break it up into 100 or so fields per form (max 250) if its a huge form.
 *  - Tested on late 2014 mbp - 2.5ghz core i7, 16gb ram
